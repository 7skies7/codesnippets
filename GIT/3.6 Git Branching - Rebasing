1) Rebaising
==================================================
	
	With the rebase command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on another one.
	
==================================================
2) Simple Rebaising
==================================================
	
	$ git checkout master

	$ git rebase FEATURE_BRANCH

	$ git rebase --onto master server client

	Take the client branch, figure out the patches since it diverged from the server branch, and replay these patches in the client branch as if it was based directly off the master branch instead.
