==================================================
1) Stashing
==================================================
	
	Often, when you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on something else. The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is the git stash command.
	
==================================================
2) Stashing your work
==================================================
	
	$ git stash / git stash save (Will stash only modified & staged tracked files)

	$ git stash -u (Will also stash the untracked files)

	$ git stash --patch (Will give a prompt to choose which files need to be stashed)

	To push a new stash onto your stack, run git stash or git stash save

==================================================
2) List your stash
==================================================
	
	$ git stash list
	stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file
	stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert "added file_size"
	stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log


==================================================
2) Apply your stash
==================================================
	
	$ git stash apply

	This will apply the most recent stash.

	$ git stash apply stash@{2}

	This will apply the stash@{2} stack/commit.

	$ git stash apply --index

	This will apply the stack with the staged commits.(i.e files which were added to the staging area)


==================================================
2) POP your stash
==================================================
	
	$ git stash pop

	This will apply your stack and immediately drop the stack.

==================================================
2) Drop your stash
==================================================
	
	$ git stash drop <stashName>

	This will drop the stack.


==================================================
2) Cleaning your Working Directory
==================================================
	
	$ git clean -d -n

	$ git clean -f -d

	stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file
	stash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert "added file_size"
	stash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log
